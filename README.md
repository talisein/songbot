Work In Progress
================

This repo will contain a database of Hatsune Miku songs that appear in live
concerts (e.g. Miku Expo, Magical Mirai, Snow Miku, etc). Except instead of
database, the data will just be C++26 constexpr std::arrays in a module.

I plan on having a few different applications, such as a Discord bot, a GNOME
search provider, maybe an interactive local CLI version of the discord bot,
stuff like that.

One major use for this repo is to play with C++26 and C++ modules. Meson doesn't
support modules so I'm hacking it pretty roughly for now with custom
targets. This means it may be difficult to compile for anyone who isn't me.
